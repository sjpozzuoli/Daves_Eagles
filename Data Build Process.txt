Starting with the Zillow Inventory by Month table as the 'base', drop the first two columns - "RegionID" and "SizeRank" as these don't add useful indexing information and could potentially confuse the model.

To add the effective tax data, quickly translated the "State" column of Effective_Tax_2021 to the State acronyms. Using a quick Index/Match function, we can map the tax rates onto the cities. This could also be accomplished grouping on larger datasets. 


To add the Happiest_Cities data, we can map the RegionName column to the City column using Index/Match.

Similar methodology was used to add the population data, spread across the 200 Most Populated Cities and Population Change datasets.
