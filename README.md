Group 4 Final Project

Presentation

1. Selected topic
- We chose to examine historical real estate and city data to predict the next city that will see a real estate "boom"
2. Reason why the topic was selected
- The topic was selected because we thought it was a relevant piece of information in the current age, with many people moving out of big cities and to the "suburbs". 
3. Description of their source of data
- We have begun to source data from multiple places like Zillow and the newly reprted Census data to build a picture of the historical information about these cities. From there we will attempt to determine which factors are most important when implementing the unsupervised machine learning aspect of the project.
4. Questions we hope to answer with the data
- We hope to answer the question of which city will see an increase in real estate prices due to an influx of new residents. We will also attempt to determine which cities would be ideal for investing in real estate prior to this rush.
