## First Segment Rubric

### A) Presentation

### B) Github Repository - (Steve)
Main Branch
  - Readme
  - Individual Branches (Lucy, Nate, Andrew, Steve, David)

### C) Machine Learning Model - (David, Andrew, Nat, Lucy, Steve)
Present a provisional machine learning model:
  - Takes in data from the provisional database
  - Output labels for input data

Main Objective/Problem/What are we trying to predict? 
- Predicing housing sale prices
- Does something(feature) affect housing prices in a certain location?

What model are we going to use?
- Unsupervised ML Model
- Binary classification or clustering?

How are you training your model? - 

How does this model work? - 

#### Datasets/Features for model (Lucy, Andrew, Nat, David)
- Inventory by month - inventory_by_month.csv
- Median sale price by city - median_sales_prices.csv
- Median days to pending by city - median_days_pending.csv
- Zillow Rankings - bedrooms_ready.csv
- Tax Rates - effective_tax_rate_2021.xlsx
- Cost of Living - advisorsmith_cost_of_living_index.csv
- Happiest Cities - happiest_cities.xlsx
- Mortgage Rates (Freddie Mac 15-yr fixed) - mortgage_long.csv
- Stock Market Indicator - 
- Population data - 

### D) Database Ingestion - (Nat)
Present a provisional db that stands in for the final db that accomplishes the following:
  - Sample data that mimics the expected final db structure or scheme
  - Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional db
