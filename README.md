Working off the assumption we're going to be using some of the Zillow datasets as the basis of our analysis, I wanted to find a few sources that could help us select which cities to focus our analysis on. 

1. Source: https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities
Shows the most populated cities in the US for 2021 - since our goal is to explore 'up and coming' cities, we can use this to potentially drop cities that are too large in the Zillow data. 

2.Source: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/econ/mhs/month-of-shipment.html
Sale price by month in case we want to dive further into 'when to move' after doing the machine learning component. 

3. Source: US Census Bureau (looking for link!)
Population change for cities between 2018-2019, which could help narrow cities that are already on a growth trajectory.
