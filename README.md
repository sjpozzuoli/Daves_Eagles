Group 4 Final Project

### Lucy: 

Added three data sets with two visual explanations (a screenshot of a graph from the rental dataset below). Two commits… I haven’t fleshed out the stories of the last dataset yet. I threw the rental and single family dataset into tableau and got the following graphs. 

The following graph from the Metro_ZORI_AllHomesPlusMultifamily_SSA.csv dataset shows the highest rental prices per city and also the most variation of rental prices (the thicker the line, the more variation in rental prices). Analysis: the largest change in rental price = the more desirable the city currently. (but are the cities with more stable prices more attractive because there is less current competition?)

I made the following graph out of the data set mentioned below: my thinking is that ‘the best city to move to’ would not be any of the top (10?) that the average family unit is jumping sky high. San Jose is the highest but this graph will show any lines we hover over when looked at in Tableau after transposing the data in Excell so that the dates were rows and the cities were columns.
