Group 4 Final Project

### Lucy: 

With the goal of discovering and finalizing data sets, I chose the following three datasets and story lines that I thought might lead us to our goal of discovering 'The Best Place to Move (Live?) in 2022'. 

Added three data sets with three visual explanations (a screenshot of a graph from the rental dataset below). Four commits… I threw the rental and single family dataset into tableau and got the following graphs. 

The following graph from the Metro_ZORI_AllHomesPlusMultifamily_SSA.csv dataset shows the highest rental prices per city and also the most variation of rental prices (the thicker the line, the more variation in rental prices). Analysis: the largest change in rental price = the more desirable the city currently. (but are the cities with more stable prices more attractive because there is less current competition?)

I made the following graph out of the data set mentioned below: my thinking is that ‘the best city to move to’ would not be any of the top (10?) that the average family unit is jumping sky high. San Jose is the highest but this graph will show any lines we hover over when looked at in Tableau after transposing the data in Excell so that the dates were rows and the cities were columns.

Finally, I thought it would be interesting to see how long each house is on the market before it sells, per state over time. This would potentially be an indicator of the LEAST desireable places to a purchase home currently. I also transposed this data in Excell to get the time line.

All thee graphs are on Tableau and ready for further investigation.
