Group 4 Final Project

## SECOND SEGMENT RUBRIC

### This Week: “Build The Pieces”

*Train your model and build out the database you’ll use for your final presentation.*

By the end of this segment, you’ll will have: 
- Connected your machine learning model into the project
- Integrated and Optimized the database into the project
- Have all necessary GitHub branches merged
- Iterated on your dashboard

### Choose Your Machine Learning Model:

#### *You have the data, what do you hope to get out of it?*
- Step 1: Analyze the input data.
- Step 2: Analyze the output data.
- Step 3: Choose your algorithm - Clustering Algos
- Step 4: Analyze the results and review accuracy

#### What are we looking for in the data?
- Looking for unexpected things to pop up like structures, clusters and groupings we would have never thought of otherwise. 
- Simplifying the process of buying a home by pinpointing the most important features

### Second Segment Grading Criteria:
01 - Presentation outlines the project (15 points)
02 - All code in main GitHub repo branch is production ready
03 - Code is submitted for the machine learning model (30 points)
04 - Presentation of a fully integrated database (30 points)
05 - A blueprint for the dashboard is created (15 points)


## First Segment Rubric

### A) Presentation

### B) Github Repository - (Steve)
Main Branch
  - Readme
  - Individual Branches (Lucy, Nate, Andrew, Steve, David)

### C) Machine Learning Model - (David, Andrew, Nat, Lucy, Steve)
Present a provisional machine learning model:
  - Takes in data from the provisional database
  - Output labels for input data

Main Objective/Problem/What are we trying to predict? 
- Predicing housing sale prices
- Does something(feature) affect housing prices in a certain location?

What model are we going to use?
- Unsupervised ML Model
- Binary classification or clustering?

How are you training your model? - 

How does this model work? - 

#### Datasets/Features for model (Lucy, Andrew, Nat, David)
- Inventory by month - inventory_by_month.csv
- Median sale price by city - median_sales_prices.csv
- Median days to pending by city - median_days_pending.csv
- Zillow Rankings - bedrooms_ready.csv
- Tax Rates - effective_tax_rate_2021.xlsx
- Cost of Living - advisorsmith_cost_of_living_index.csv
- Happiest Cities - happiest_cities.xlsx
- Mortgage Rates (Freddie Mac 15-yr fixed) - mortgage_long.csv

### D) Database Ingestion - (Nat)
Present a provisional db that stands in for the final db that accomplishes the following:
  - Sample data that mimics the expected final db structure or scheme
  - Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional db
