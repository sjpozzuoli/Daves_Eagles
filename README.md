#### Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI)
The Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) is Zillowâ€™s flagship measure of both the typical home value as well as housing market appreciation currently and over time. It offers a number of advantages over other housing indices, including better timeliness, better coverage of the market and more visibility into changes in small market segments.

Zillow organizes their data by several geographies including state, metro, county, city, zip code or neighborhood.
