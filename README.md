I decided do add some data with indirect or minor impact on choice of location to live. 
Tax rates differ between satates and may play decisive role in the assesment. The following dataset consist effective tax rate for all states.

Here is also Cost of living index data set by city. The index is constructed such that the average U.S. cost of living is normalized to 100. The cost of living was determined based on six major categories of expenses: food, housing, utilities, transportation, healthcare, and consumer discretionary spending.

Another dataset reflect happiness score among more than 180 of the largest U.S. cities. The score calculated across three key dimensions: 1) Emotional & Physical Well-Being, 2) Income & Employment and 3) Community & Environment.
